Sublime syntax highlighting support for LDMud / LPC (Lars PensjÃ¶ C)

This is an early working draft of Sublime Text 3 syntax highlighting for the LPC language, used to develop within LDMud. I don't recommend anyone start basing themes on this yet (unless they're okay with repeating work.) If you know what this project is for, I could use your help pushing it forwards (especially when it comes to scope naming, where I have almost no experience and am staring down some significant decision fatigue.)

See the TODO file in the root for my current working notes if you'd like to help.

If you have any business installing this at this point, you should be able to figure out how to do so from the ST3 documentation. (In short, it should suffice to git clone this into your ST3/Packages/User/) directory, open up an LPC file, and select LPC, or User->LPC for your syntax.

See http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html for details on the syntax format.
