Sublime syntax highlighting support for LDMud / LPC (Lars Pensj√∂ C)

This is a working draft of Sublime Text 3 syntax highlighting for the LPC language, used to develop within LDMud. If you know what this project is for, I could use your help pushing it forwards.

While you can see the TODO file in root for my current working notes if you'd like to help, the TLDR version is that I could use your help with a short list of things:

1. identifying missing language features, edge cases in current matching, scopes that should be matched but aren't, scopes that need renaming, etc.
3. gathering feedback on the "Open" questions in the TODO
4. finishing out a robust, compiling syntax_test of the LPC language (see /test for a rough draft).

If you have any business installing this at this point, you should be able to figure out how to do so from the ST3 documentation. (In short, it should suffice to git clone this into your ST3/Packages/) directory, open up an LPC file, and select LPC for your syntax.

See http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html for details on the syntax format.
